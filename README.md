Cross-disciplinary studies - Agronomy and Data


In this project we'll build an esp-32 based instrument for measuring hydraulic properties of soil. 

Take a look in the folder <a href="https://github.com/deedeeharris/agritech2021/tree/main/ard-sketch">'ard-sketch'</a> to see the sketch for our SHC Meter.

In addition, for detailed instructions take a look at our instructable: https://www.instructables.com/Measuring-Hydraulic-Properties-of-Soil-With-ESP32/
