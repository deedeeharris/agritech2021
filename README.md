# Our first AgriTech project - Yedidya and Yehuda
Bilingual studies - Agronomy and Data


In this project we'll build an esp-32 based instrument for measuring hydraulic properties of soil. 

Take a look in the folder 'ard-sketch' to see the sketches for the different sensors. 

We'll add here photos and the full code.

## Building the model:

### The pipe (for holding the saturated soil):

Materials:
* Piece of PVC pipe (7cm * ?? * ??) + cover
* 2 * PG-7
* Glue
* Thin plastic pipe (like in fish tanks / irrigation)
* ...

Instructions:
1. Cut a peice of the pipe.
2. Drills two holes for the PG, 2 cm apart.
