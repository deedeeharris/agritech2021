# Our first AgriTech project - Yedidya and Yehuda
Cross-disciplinary studies - Agronomy and Data


**Soil Hydraulic Conductivity Meter (SHC Meter)

In this project we'll build an esp-32 based instrument for measuring hydraulic properties of soil.

With this **SHC Meter** one can plot the Retention Curve of a saturated soil and get its hydraulic conductivity.

The retention curve is of great importance in describing the hydraulic properties of the soil and is required for the purpose of modeling flow and conveyance processes, for the benefit of irrigation management and many other applications related to the management or evaluation of groundwater. Hydraulic conductivity is very important in agriculture in the context of irrigation and soil feeding.

Take a look in the folder <a href="https://github.com/deedeeharris/agritech2021/tree/main/ard-sketch">'ard-sketch'</a> to see the sketch for our SHC Meter.

All the best,
