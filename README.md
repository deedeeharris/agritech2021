# Our first AgriTech project - Yedidya and Yehuda
Bilingual studies - Agronomy and Data


In this project we'll build an esp-32 based instrument for measuring hydraulic properties of soil. 

Take a look in the folder 'ard-sketch' to see the sketches for the different sensors. 

We'll add here photos and the full code.
